[01:15.66] It seems like a day
[01:23.86] A day that I call smooth
[01:30.11] When you came into my heart I knew
[01:40.14] The love was overflowing
[01:45.52] And I say
[01:48.27] La la la la la!
[01:55.77] 
[02:22.11] The day was so long and the night was still
[02:32.25] And you kept coming over
[02:35.88] To my hill
[02:40.33] I would weep for the day
[02:48.59] Without you, all the way
[02:59.45] You wanted to be free
[03:08.56] And doubt would overflow
[03:15.81] Just come running to me
[03:24.08] 'Cause you knew I'd take you home
[03:40.58] 
[03:33.17] Then you came into my heart
[03:37.69] We knew for a start
[03:41.21] Each word like a book
[03:45.70] With your spirit flowing ...over me
[03:58.42] Don't bother to close your heart
[03:59.29] Let's drink honey in the park
[04:05.86] Swap hats and go for free
[04:10.42] To our secret garden
