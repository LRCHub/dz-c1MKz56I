I loved it
I loved it
I loved it
I loved it

My secret garden's not so secret anymore
Run from the house
Holding my head in my hands
Feeling dejected
Feeling like a trauma
I feel

This should have a clue
I have to have a secret
I hate to get one of mine

My secret garden's not so secret anymore
My secret garden's not so secret anymore

Run through the fields
Down to the edge of the water
Castello he got a reason
Look at me
Take me by the house
I'll have to keep running
I just can't see the bus

My secret garden's not so secret anymore

It should be so easy
You just wish for hours

I loved it
I loved it
I loved it
Playing a fool
I loved it
Made it blue
Take a look
I loved it

Playing a fool
I loved it
Made it blue
Take a look
I loved it

Playing a fool
I loved it
Made it blue
Take a look
I loved it
I loved it
I loved it

This should have a clue
I have to have a secret
I hate to get one of mine

My secret garden's not so secret anymore

This should have a clue
I have to have a secret
I hate to get one of mine

My secret garden's not so secret anymore

This should have a clue
I have to have a secret
I hate to get one of mine

My secret garden's not so secret anymore

This should have a clue
I have to have a secret
I hate to get one of mine

My secret garden's not so secret anymore

Run from the house
Holding my head in my hands
